                <p>A 20-year-old man named Bon Gregory D. Velasco hails from Nagsaraboan, Bacnotan in La Union. In
                    Lorma Colleges Special Science High School in San Juan, La Union, he finished his junior and senior years
                    of high school. He is a level 2 nursing student at Saint Louis University in Baguio City right now. He is
                    committed to upholding the principles of compassion, empathy, and patient-centered care. He
                    recognizes that every patient deserves respect and dignity, that healing begins with listening to their
                    stories and needs, and that addressing those needs with both the art and science of nursing. He also
                    recognizes that learning never stops and that the greatest reward comes from changing someone's life,
                    even if it's just one patient at a time.</p>

            To begin with, my family has five members, including me. My parents are both doctors and became
            politicians in my mother's hometown San Gabriel after. Both my older brother and sister study in
            Manila. My brother Jeremiah enrolled in an Information Technology course in Far Eastern University,
            and my sister studying political sciences in Ateneo De Manila. We also have five loving Dobermans.

      <h1 class = "statetitle">Personal Statement</h1>
      <p>My path to becoming a licensed nurse as a second-year college student has been gratifying and tough at the same time. Through my experiences, I've come to understand that nursing is a calling rather than merely a career. I know firsthand the value of caring, knowledgeable nurses who can give their patients the very best treatment because I've had many medical operations done in hospitals.
        My guiding principle as an aspiring professional nurse is the idea that every patient deserves to be treated with respect, sensitivity, and decency. I think a nurse's job description includes advocating for their patients and their families as much as just providing medical care. It's crucial to give patients a secure and pleasant atmosphere while also attending to their specific needs.
        I hope to go into medicine after nursing school in addition to provide good patient care. My own experiences as a patient have motivated me to pursue a career in medicine so that I may offer a comprehensive approach to patient treatment. I think that working as a nurse will help me to acquire important knowledge and abilities that will better equip me to handle the demands of becoming a doctor.
        Overall, I've been inspired to seek a career as a professional nurse by my experiences as a patient and my passion for healthcare. I am eager to start this adventure and positively impact the lives of individuals I work with.</p>
